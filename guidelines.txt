list of all things that need to be labeled:
doors - various numbers and colors of keys
thief
totem - with gems in it and without

traps - need to consider all levels of traps
saw
red guard
cannon
seeker bird
homing cannon
spinner
ricochet
dragon
roaster
warder
bloodhound
electro cannon
spider
funny jumping green dude

anti grav - activated and deactivated
board
trampoline


guidelines for simple vision:
for the first instance of the bot, let's keep it simple.

must haves:
door
totem - with varying rituals going
thief

let's go with these traps:
saw
red guard
cannon
seeker bird
100 - homing cannon
100 - spinner
ricochet
dragon
warder
100 - bloodhound
electro cannon

these i really want to avoid for the simpler version:
roaster - not really sure how i'd categorize the value of the roaster circle filling
spider - alters the game state too much
anti grav, board, trampoline - too much headache, especially with board and trampoline tech

for each group of 3 traps i'll get 100 screenshots in 30-30-40 increments (or 30-30-20)
door and totem in different places
1 with totem no gems, 2 with gems but different rituals running
traps in different places too
